instantSlideshow
================

A quick and painless way to create a fullscreen slideshow for the iPad. After linking to the script, you simply declare how many slides you're planning on using and init the function. For simplicity, it's currently setup to load images called [number].jpg. This was originally created as a presentation tool for pitches so creative teams could page through their work for the client.
